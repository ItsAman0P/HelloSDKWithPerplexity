# ChatWidget Debug Information

## Issue Fixed: ChatWidget Not Showing

### Problem
The ChatWidget was not displaying, only showing the header "Contact Us".

### Root Cause
The main issue was in the fallback `setupWithDirectWebView()` method:
1. The method created a local `webViewManager` variable but didn't store it as an instance variable
2. The `loadHtmlContentDirect()` method was not actually loading HTML into the WebView - it was just logging
3. This meant that when the fragment setup failed (which happens in Compose AndroidView context), the fallback had no way to actually display content

### Solution
1. **Fixed Fallback WebView Setup**: 
   - Added `fallbackWebViewManager` instance variable
   - Store the WebView manager properly in fallback mode
   - Actually load HTML content in the fallback WebView

2. **Added Proper Logging**:
   - Enhanced logging to track fragment vs fallback mode
   - Added debugging to understand which code path is taken

3. **Fixed Resource Management**:
   - Proper cleanup for both fragment and fallback modes
   - Updated all methods to handle both modes correctly

### Code Changes

#### ChatWidget.kt
- Added `fallbackWebViewManager` instance variable
- Fixed `setupWithDirectWebView()` to properly initialize and store WebView manager
- Fixed `loadHtmlContentDirect()` to actually load HTML into WebView
- Updated cleanup and utility methods to handle fallback mode
- Enhanced logging throughout

#### ChatWidgetFragment.kt
- Added debugging logs to track initialization

### Expected Behavior Now

1. **In FragmentActivity Context** (like regular Activities):
   - Uses fragment-based approach for proper file upload support
   - Should see logs: "FragmentManager found: true" and "Successfully setup with fragment"

2. **In Compose AndroidView Context**:
   - Falls back to direct WebView approach (file upload may be limited)
   - Should see logs: "No FragmentManager available, using direct WebView"
   - WebView should still display the chat interface

### Testing
1. Build and run the app
2. Navigate to Settings screen (which uses Compose AndroidView)
3. Chat widget should now be visible
4. Check logs to see which mode is being used

### File Upload Support
- **Fragment Mode**: Full file upload support with Activity Result API
- **Fallback Mode**: Limited file upload support (uses older approach)
- Both modes should display the chat interface correctly
